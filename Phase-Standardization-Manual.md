## The Phase Structure Philosophy

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Research-First Development**
Every implementation begins with comprehensive research using specialized MCP tools:
- **Context7 MCP**: Fetch up-to-date documentation for specific technologies
- **Perplexity MCP**: Research best practices and design patterns
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Break down complex problems systematically

#### 2. **Three-Tier Architecture**
Each phase follows a consistent three-tier structure:

**Tier 1: Infrastructure Setup**
- Database schema design and implementation
- API route creation and configuration
- Core framework and library setup
- Basic component scaffolding

**Tier 2: Business Logic and Integration**
- Feature implementation and workflows
- Service integrations and data processing
- User interaction patterns and state management
- Real-time functionality and collaboration features

**Tier 3: UI Polish and Quality Assurance**
- Visual design enhancement and animations
- Responsive design implementation
- Performance optimization and testing
- Comprehensive QA verification

#### 3. **Checkpoint-Driven Progress**
- No progression to next tier until current tier is 100% complete
- Explicit verification checkpoints at each tier boundary
- Git commits and pushes required after each tier completion

## Best Practices and Lessons Learned

### Research-First Development

**Best Practice**: Always research before implementing
- Use Context7 MCP to get authoritative documentation
- Use Perplexity MCP to understand current best practices
- Research saves time and prevents architectural mistakes

**Lesson Learned**: Skipping research leads to rework
- Implementations without research often require refactoring
- Best practices research prevents common pitfalls
- Documentation research ensures API compatibility

### Component Consistency

**Best Practice**: Use Magic UI MCP for all components
- Ensures consistent design system adherence
- Reduces custom styling and maintenance overhead
- Provides accessible and responsive components by default

**Lesson Learned**: Manual component creation creates inconsistency
- Custom components often lack accessibility features
- Styling inconsistencies emerge across the application
- Maintenance becomes more complex over time

### Quality Assurance Integration

**Best Practice**: Use Operative.sh MCP for systematic testing
- Automated testing catches issues early
- Visual verification ensures design compliance
- Performance testing validates scalability

**Lesson Learned**: Manual testing is insufficient
- Human testing misses edge cases
- Visual inconsistencies are hard to spot manually
- Performance issues only emerge under load

### Tier-Based Development

**Best Practice**: Complete each tier fully before proceeding
- Prevents incomplete foundations from causing issues
- Ensures proper testing at each level
- Creates natural review and validation points

**Lesson Learned**: Skipping tiers creates technical debt
- Incomplete infrastructure causes integration problems
- Missing business logic creates user experience gaps
- Inadequate QA leads to production issues

### Git Discipline

**Best Practice**: Commit and push after each tier
- Creates clear development history
- Enables easy rollback if needed
- Provides natural collaboration points

**Lesson Learned**: Irregular commits create confusion
- Large commits are hard to review
- Missing history makes debugging difficult
- Collaboration becomes challenging without clear checkpoints

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### MCP Integration Issues

**Problem**: Context7 library ID not found
```
Error: Library "/invalid/library" not found
```
**Solution**: 
1. Use `mcp1_resolve-library-id` to find correct library ID
2. Verify organization and repository names
3. Check if library is supported by Context7

**Problem**: Perplexity research queries too broad
```
Result: Generic information not specific to use case
```
**Solution**:
1. Make queries more specific to the implementation context
2. Include technology stack in the query
3. Ask for specific patterns or approaches

**Problem**: Magic UI components not matching design system
```
Result: Inconsistent styling across components
```
**Solution**:
1. Reference template directories in search queries
2. Use more specific component descriptions
3. Include design system keywords in search

### Tier Checkpoint Issues

**Problem**: Unclear when tier is "complete"
```
Issue: Subjective completion criteria
```
**Solution**:
1. Define specific verification criteria for each subtask
2. Use Operative.sh MCP for objective testing
3. Create explicit acceptance criteria

**Problem**: Git commits too large or unclear
```
Issue: Difficult to review or rollback changes
```
**Solution**:
1. Follow exact commit message format
2. Ensure commits only include tier-specific changes
3. Use descriptive achievement summaries

### Research Integration Issues

**Problem**: Research not actionable
```
Issue: Generic best practices not applicable to specific implementation
```
**Solution**:
1. Make research queries more context-specific
2. Include current technology stack in queries
3. Ask for specific implementation patterns

**Problem**: Documentation research outdated
```
Issue: Context7 returns deprecated information
```
**Solution**:
1. Specify version in library ID if available
2. Cross-reference with Perplexity for current practices
3. Verify information against official sources

### Quality Assurance Issues

**Problem**: Operative.sh testing not comprehensive
```
Issue: QA verification missing edge cases
```
**Solution**:
1. Define specific testing scenarios
2. Include performance and accessibility criteria
3. Test across multiple device types and browsers

**Problem**: Visual verification subjective
```
Issue: Design compliance unclear
```
**Solution**:
1. Reference specific design system components
2. Include accessibility requirements
3. Define objective visual criteria
