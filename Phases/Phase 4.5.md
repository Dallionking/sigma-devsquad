- Added usage statistics display showing Total Monthly Cost, Total Tokens, and Total Requests
- Fixed TypeScript errors and missing useUsageStats hook
- Dashboard now fully functional with all features working correctly

## Phase Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (QA VERIFIED)

All major features have been implemented including:
- Dashboard infrastructure and page setup
- All modal components (Add, Edit, Rotate, Revoke)
- React Query integration with comprehensive hooks
- Provider-specific integrations for 8+ providers
- Usage tracking and analytics
- Permission and access control system
- UI enhancements and visualizations

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior Frontend Engineer with 9+ years experience at Google or Microsoft, specializing in dashboard design, security interfaces, and API key management systems. Experience with TypeScript, Next.js, and secure credential management. Background in user permission systems, encryption handling, and intuitive management interfaces is highly valuable.

## Feature Description
The LLM Key Management Dashboard feature implements a dedicated interface at `/dashboard/llm-keys` for managing API keys for various LLM providers. This feature builds upon the existing LLMKeyManager component and backend infrastructure from Phase 4, creating a comprehensive dashboard for adding, editing, monitoring, and revoking LLM API keys in a new Next.js project.
