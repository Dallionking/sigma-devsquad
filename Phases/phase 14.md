# 14. AI-Powered Testing with Browser Automation

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior QA Automation Engineer with 9+ years experience at Google or Microsoft, specializing in automated testing frameworks, browser automation, and AI-assisted test generation. Experience with TypeScript, Next.js, Playwright/Puppeteer, and modern testing frameworks. Background in machine learning for test optimization, UI/UX testing, and visual regression testing is highly valuable.

## Feature Description
The AI-Powered Testing feature implements comprehensive browser automation for QA and testing, similar to Operative.sh's approach. This feature enables AI agents to directly interact with web interfaces for testing, debugging, and research purposes, providing a complete browser automation solution with test generation, visual verification, and interactive debugging in a new Next.js project.
