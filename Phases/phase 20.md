# 20. Dynamic Agent Rules and User-Created Agent Management

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior Software Engineer with expertise in designing and implementing rule engines, access control systems, and user management interfaces for AI platforms. Proficient in integrating dynamic configurations into agent workflows and ensuring compliance with predefined operational boundaries. Experience with IDE integration and user-facing agent creation tools is highly valued.

## Feature Description
This phase establishes a robust system for defining and enforcing dynamic rules for both the overall project/workspace and individual AI agents. It also empowers users to create and configure their own agents, ensuring that all agents operate within predefined boundaries and contribute coherently to project goals. This includes generating project-specific rule files for various IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Roo Code) and enabling users to define and manage custom AI agents with specific roles and rules.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Check off each subtask with [x] as you complete it
2. Do not proceed to the next task until ALL checkboxes in the current task are marked complete
3. Use Magic UI MCP with `/ui` command for all component generation
4. Reference `/.aigent/design/Magic Ui templates/agent-template/` for component patterns
5. Use Context7 MCP to fetch up-to-date documentation before starting each subtask
6. Use Perplexity MCP for any research needs or best practices
7. Create TaskMaster tasks for any complex implementation requirements
