# 10. WebContainer Integration

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Full-stack engineer with 8+ years of experience in modern web development, specializing in React, Node.js, and real-time communication, with a strong background in integrating third-party APIs and building scalable development tools.

## Feature Description
This phase delivers the integration of WebContainers (`webcontainers.io/api`) into the Vibe DevSquad platform. The primary goal is to provide users with instant, zero-setup, in-browser development environments that seamlessly integrate with Vibe DevSquad's AI orchestration capabilities. This integration will enhance the user experience by enabling real-time code generation, execution, and testing directly within the application, fostering a truly unified AI-assisted development workflow.

The WebContainer will be integrated as a new primary navigation item, tentatively named **"Workspace"** or **"Code Editor,"** positioned logically within the existing navigation hierarchy (e.g., between "Planning Agent" and "Tasks"). This section will serve as the central hub for project-specific coding and interaction with AI agents.

**Key UI/UX Principles:**
*   **Seamless Transition:** Users should move effortlessly from planning (Planning Agent) to coding (Workspace) to task management (Tasks).
*   **Contextual Loading:** The Workspace will automatically load the relevant project environment when a project is selected or a task is initiated.
*   **Integrated AI Interaction:** A dedicated panel within the Workspace will allow direct communication with AI agents and display real-time feedback from code generation, testing, and deployment.
*   **Familiarity:** The in-browser IDE will mimic the look and feel of popular code editors (e.g., VS Code) to minimize the learning curve.
