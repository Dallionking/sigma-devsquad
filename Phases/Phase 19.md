# 19. Agent Memory and Context Management

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior AI/ML Engineer with extensive experience in designing and implementing scalable memory systems for AI agents, including vector databases, knowledge graphs, and context management. Proficient in optimizing LLM context windows and ensuring data consistency across distributed agent systems. Experience with Mem.io or similar shared memory solutions is highly desirable.

## Feature Description
This phase focuses on implementing a robust and shared memory system for all Vibe DevSquad AI agents, enabling them to maintain context, share knowledge, and learn collaboratively across tasks and sessions. It will also establish advanced context management strategies to optimize token usage and ensure coherent, long-term understanding within complex projects. This system will integrate project logs (`current_status.md`, `changelog.md`, `project_bio.md`, `features.md`) directly into the shared memory, providing a consistent and up-to-date knowledge base for all agents.
