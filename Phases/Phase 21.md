# 21. Project Logging and Context Sharing

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior Software Engineer with expertise in designing and implementing robust logging, auditing, and context management systems for distributed applications. Proficient in ensuring data consistency and facilitating inter-process communication for shared knowledge bases. Experience with version control systems and real-time data synchronization is highly valued.

## Feature Description
This phase establishes a dedicated system for agents to track and update project-related logs and files, ensuring consistent context and information sharing across all agents and project phases. This includes managing `current_status.md`, `changelog.md`, `project_bio.md`, and `features.md` files. The system will ensure that agents have a shared understanding of the project's state, history, and future direction, facilitating seamless collaboration and continuity.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Check off each subtask with [x] as you complete it
2. Do not proceed to the next task until ALL checkboxes in the current task are marked complete
3. Use Magic UI MCP with `/ui` command for all component generation
4. Reference `/.aigent/design/Magic Ui templates/agent-template/` for component patterns
5. Use Context7 MCP to fetch up-to-date documentation before starting each subtask
6. Use Perplexity MCP for any research needs or best practices
7. Create TaskMaster tasks for any complex implementation requirements
