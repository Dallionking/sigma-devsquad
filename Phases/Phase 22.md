# 22. Agent Behavioral Patterns and Double-Checking

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior AI Research Engineer with expertise in designing and implementing advanced agent behavioral models, self-correction mechanisms, and robust validation frameworks. Proficient in developing systems that enhance AI reliability, accuracy, and adherence to complex rules. Experience with formal verification methods and anomaly detection in AI systems is highly valued.

## Feature Description
This phase focuses on implementing advanced behavioral patterns for AI agents, including a robust double-check mechanism to ensure accuracy, reliability, and adherence to defined rules before executing actions. This will enhance the agents' ability to self-correct, prevent errors, and operate with a higher degree of autonomy and trustworthiness. The system will integrate self-reflection, pre-execution validation, and potentially peer review to create a multi-layered verification process.

3. Use Magic UI MCP with `/ui` command for all component generation
4. Reference `/.aigent/design/Magic Ui templates/agent-template/` for component patterns
5. Use Context7 MCP to fetch up-to-date documentation before starting each subtask
6. Use Perplexity MCP for any research needs or best practices
