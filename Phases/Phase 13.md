# 13. Collaborative Planning Sessions

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior Collaboration Engineer with 9+ years experience at Google or Microsoft, specializing in real-time collaboration systems, shared editing experiences, and multi-user interfaces. Experience with TypeScript, Next.js, WebSockets, and conflict resolution algorithms. Background in Google Docs-style collaboration, operational transforms, and presence awareness is highly valuable.

## Feature Description
The Collaborative Planning Sessions feature enables multiple team members to join Planning Agent conversations simultaneously, creating a Google Docs-like experience for AI-assisted project planning. This feature implements a complete real-time collaboration solution with shared context, presence awareness, and synchronized interactions with the Planning Agent in a new Next.js project.
