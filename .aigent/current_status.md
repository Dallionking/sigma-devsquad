## Recent Accomplishments

### Phase 4.5 - LLM Key Management Dashboard (COMPLETED - 2025-06-07)
- **Fixed overlapping API key cards layout issue** in LLMKeyDashboardOptimized component
- Replaced virtual scrolling implementation with proper CSS grid layout
- Implemented responsive grid: `grid gap-8 auto-rows-fr lg:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3`
- Maintained all accessibility features and ARIA attributes
- **Established comprehensive QA testing protocols** using web-eval-agent MCP
- Created visual inspection requirements alongside error code checks
- Verified layout fixes through automated screenshot testing
- Documented memory management rules for checkpoint summaries
- **Performance optimizations implemented:**
  - Data loading optimizations (pagination, caching, background refresh)

- Configured Tailwind with custom theme
- Created Supabase client configuration with type safety
- Created placeholder UI components (Container, Button, FormField)
- Created authentication hook (useAuth)
- Created Supabase database type definitions
- Added environment variable validation using Zod
- Created mock MCP integrations (Claude Task Master, Google A2A, Mem0.ai)
- Set up ESLint and Prettier tooling
- Created Jest and React Testing Library configuration
- Added test scripts to package.json
- Created example test for Container component
- Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Created comprehensive README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
- Updated design system document to canonical status
- Created all core .aigent documentation files
- Established project rules and operational protocols
- Set up directory structure for documentation

### Phase 1 - Preparation
- Analyzed existing Loveable Template (reference)
- Created Navbar component
- Created animation utilities
- Set up basic landing page structure with all sections
- Configured Inter font and updated metadata

- Added checkpoint markers between major task sections

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 5 - MCP Management System**: Begin database schema design for MCP management
2. Create Supabase tables for MCP permissions, usage logs, and orchestration rules
3. Implement Next.js API routes for MCP management operations
4. Set up MCP adapter framework with factory pattern
5. Build MCP configuration and testing interfaces
6. Integrate with existing dashboard architecture

## Technology Stack Updates
