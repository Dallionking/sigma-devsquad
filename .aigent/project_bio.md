# Vibe Dev Squad - Project Biography

## Project Overview
Vibe Dev Squad is an AI-powered development squad management platform that leverages advanced AI agents and automation to streamline software development workflows. The platform features a comprehensive dashboard system with LLM key management, complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) registry and integration system, advanced task management with Kanban boards, and accessibility-first design.

## Core Mission
To create an intelligent, collaborative development environment where AI agents work alongside human developers to enhance productivity, maintain code quality, and accelerate project delivery through seamless MCP integration, comprehensive task management, and accessibility-focused design.

## Key Features
- **MCP Registry & Integration System**: Complete MCP management with registry, configuration management, planning agent orchestration, usage analytics, and adapter framework
- **Task Management System**: Comprehensive API infrastructure with CRUD operations, dependencies with circular detection, comments, attachments, history tracking, and drag-and-drop Kanban board
- **LLM Key Management Dashboard**: Complete CRUD operations for API key management with responsive grid layout
- **Accessibility-First Design**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with custom accessibility hooks and keyboard navigation
- **Advanced Security**: Credential encryption, role-based access control, rate limiting, audit logging, and Row-Level Security policies
- **Performance Optimization**: Grid-based layouts, React Query caching, optimistic UI updates, and database query optimization

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.3 with Turbopack, React 18, TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive grid utilities and custom accessibility enhancements
- **Data Management**: React Query with optimistic updates and background refresh
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with custom accessibility hooks
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with type-safe client and real-time subscriptions
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, web-eval-agent MCP for automated UI testing
- **AI Integration**: Multiple MCP servers (Context7, Perplexity, GitHub, Supabase, Task Master)
- **Accessibility**: Custom hooks (useAriaLive, useFocusStyles, useHighContrast, useKeyboardShortcuts)

## Architecture Highlights
- **Responsive Grid Layouts**: CSS Grid with `auto-rows-fr` for consistent card heights
- **Virtual Scrolling Replacement**: Performance-optimized grid layouts over complex virtualization
- **Accessibility Hooks**: Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support
- **MCP Orchestration**: Adapter pattern for seamless AI agent integration
- **QA Automation**: Visual inspection protocols with screenshot analysis

## Project Structure
- **Phases**: Development organized into 11 phases (Phase 0-10)
- **Current Status**: Phase 5 completed
- **Documentation**: Centralized in `.aigent/` directory with comprehensive change logs
