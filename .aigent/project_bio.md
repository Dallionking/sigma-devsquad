# Vibe Dev Squad Project Bio

## Project Overview
Vibe Dev Squad is an AI-powered development squad management platform that leverages advanced AI agents and automation to streamline software development workflows. The platform features a comprehensive dashboard system with LLM key management, accessibility-first design, and integrated MCP (Model Context Protocol) orchestration.

## Core Mission
To create an intelligent, collaborative development environment where AI agents work alongside human developers to enhance productivity, maintain code quality, and accelerate project delivery through seamless MCP integration and accessibility-focused design.

## Key Features
- **LLM Key Management Dashboard**: Complete CRUD operations for API key management with responsive grid layout
- **Accessibility-First Design**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with custom accessibility hooks and keyboard navigation
- **MCP Integration Framework**: Multiple specialized AI agents (Task Master, Context7, Magic UI, Web Eval Agent) working in concert
- **Automated QA Testing**: Visual inspection protocols with screenshot analysis and automated testing
- **Performance Optimization**: Grid-based layouts, React Query caching, and optimistic UI updates
- **Memory Persistence**: Comprehensive context retention and checkpoint management

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.3 with Turbopack, React 18, TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive grid utilities and custom accessibility enhancements
- **Data Management**: React Query with optimistic updates and background refresh
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with custom accessibility hooks
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with type-safe client and real-time subscriptions
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, web-eval-agent MCP for automated UI testing
- **AI Integration**: Multiple MCP servers (Context7, Perplexity, GitHub, Supabase, Task Master)
- **Accessibility**: Custom hooks (useAriaLive, useFocusStyles, useHighContrast, useKeyboardShortcuts)

## Architecture Highlights
- **Responsive Grid Layouts**: CSS Grid with `auto-rows-fr` for consistent card heights
- **Virtual Scrolling Replacement**: Performance-optimized grid layouts over complex virtualization
- **Accessibility Hooks**: Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support
- **MCP Orchestration**: Adapter pattern for seamless AI agent integration
- **QA Automation**: Visual inspection protocols with screenshot analysis

## Project Structure
- **Phases**: Development organized into 11 phases (Phase 0-10)
- **Current Status**: Phase 4.5 completed, Phase 5 (MCP Management) ready to begin
- **Documentation**: Centralized in `.aigent/` directory with comprehensive change logs
- **UI Templates**: Magic UI templates with accessibility enhancements
- **Rules & Protocols**: Comprehensive operational guidelines in `.windsurf/rules`

## Recent Major Achievements
- **Phase 4.5 Completion**: Fixed overlapping cards layout in LLM Keys Dashboard
- **QA Protocol Establishment**: Automated testing with visual inspection requirements
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with custom hooks
- **Performance Optimization**: Grid-based layouts with improved rendering performance
- **Memory Management**: Checkpoint summaries with comprehensive context preservation

## Success Metrics
- **Layout Issues**: 100% resolution of overlapping card problems
- **Accessibility Score**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved
- **Performance**: Improved rendering with grid layout implementation
- **QA Coverage**: Automated visual inspection with screenshot analysis
- **Development Velocity**: Task-driven development with MCP integration

## Vision
To become the leading AI-augmented development platform that seamlessly blends human creativity with AI efficiency, setting new standards for accessible, performant, and collaborative software development through comprehensive MCP orchestration and accessibility-first design principles.
